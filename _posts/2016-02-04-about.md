You might have guessed that the name of this website is derived from The Beatles' song _Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. _

I don't suppose that I am a girl with kaleidoscope eyes, but everyone has a personality like a kaleidoscope. With every milestone in life, our outlook on life changes, just as how the image in a kaleidoscope changes with every twist.

This website is an online representation of me. My likes and dislikes, my dreams, hopes, fears, and all that is.

There are just so many things that interest and excite me. Travelling, reading and DIY-ing are just some of my hobbies and I hope to share my various passions with you too.

You might have guessed that the name of this website is derived from The Beatles' song _Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds._

I thought of the girl with kaleidoscope eyes one day in the shower and realised that anyone and everyone could be someone with kaleidoscope eyes. We take on so many roles in our lives and we change accordingly to the space and environment around us. We put on different lens when viewing life and it made me realise that despite the different image that each twist of a kaleidoscope brings, the image ultimately comes from the same, one kaleidoscope. This blog is therefore is an online representation of me. My likes and dislikes, my dreams, hopes, fears, experiences, and all that is.

I want to be a tourist in my own country

When I returned from my exchange programme in Hong Kong, I vowed to take time to explore my own country as fervently as I had explored Hong Kong. 

It was a sudden realisation, after months of visiting museums, beaches and cha chan tengs that I had never given Singapore the same amount of time and effort as I had given Hong Kong. The thought saddened me and I realised that I had never visited Pulau Ubin or any other of our islands and have never visited many of our museums. 

Upon returning, I embarked on my quest to be a tourist in my own country. 

Below is a list of places that I'd like to visit:

* Kranji Marshes
* Coney Island
* Pulau Ubin
* I had no idea that there was a marshland in Kranji! Hopefully, I'll be able to visit Kranji Marshes soon enough.

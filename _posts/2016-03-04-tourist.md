Why do I want to be a tourist in my own country?

When I returned from my exchange programme in Hong Kong, I vowed to take time to explore my own country as fervently as I had explored HongKong.

It was a sudden realisation, after months of visiting museums, beaches and cha chan tengs that I had never given Singapore the same amount of time and effort as I had given Hong Kong. The thought saddened me and I realised that I had never visited Pulau Ubin or any other of our islands and have never visited many of our museums.

I then decided to embark on this quest to be a tourist in my own country.

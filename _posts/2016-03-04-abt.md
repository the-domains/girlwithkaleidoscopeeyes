Born in Singapore, raised in the fantasy world of books and now a university student, I am, at my core, just another normal human being. 

I procrastinate, dream about travelling around the world, generate "if only" questions in my head, and watch tons of television. I get most of my crazy ideas in the shower, and then scramble to write these ideas down before they disappear (aka I forget about them). Girlwithkaleidoscopeeyes.com was one of my many "shower ideas" and so, here I am, putting it into action!

I have also loved writing since forever and after several attempts at blogging, I finally decided to put my foot down to do it again, properly. I'll be writing about anything and everything- opinion pieces, travel stories, you know, things that go on in a normal human being's brain/life.

Thank you for reading and please feel free to [contact me][0] if you want to discuss something or have comments about my writing.
